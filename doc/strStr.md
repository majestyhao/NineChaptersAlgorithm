# strStr和Coding Style
## Problem
**Easy**　For a given source string and a target string, you should output the first index(from 0) of target string in source string.

If target does not exist in source, just return -1.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
If source = "source" and target = "target", return -1.

If source = "abcdabcdefg" and target = "bcd", return 1.

Challenge
O(n2) is acceptable. Can you implement an O(n) algorithm? (hint: KMP)

Clarification
Do I need to implement KMP Algorithm in a real interview?

Not necessary. When you meet this problem in a real interview, the interviewer may just want to test your basic implementation ability. But make sure your confirm with the interviewer first.

## Thoughts
KMP算法利用了pattern match思想，通过维护next数组达到减少回退次数的目的。
不过本题主要是考察coding style和bug free. 用直观的两次循环即可
